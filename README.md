Arbitrum is a Layer 2 cryptocurrency platform that makes smart contracts scalable, fast, and private. Arbitrum interoperates closely with Ethereum, so Ethereum developers can easily cross-compile their contracts to run on Arbitrum. Arbitrum achieves these goals through a unique combination of incentives, network protocol design, and virtual machine architecture. Arbitrum has three modes: channels, AnyTrust sidechains, and rollup. Channels and sidechains provide the AnyTrust Guarantee which ensures that the code will run correctly as long as any validator is honest.
